# Stock-analysis
## Excel VBA Module 2

### OverView of Stock_Analysis (VBA_Challenge) Project

	The stock analysis project analyzes an entire dataset of stock information (volume traded, starting prices and ending prices of a certain, sometimes selected, stock in a given year).
The purpose behind the project was by using different VBA formulas and functions, we could analyze several key stocks and their related information, without the need to go over them one by one, which is essentially time consuming.
At a click of a button, the project would analyze one to tens of different stocks, at any given year, analyzing key data such as the return of an example stock.

# Stock-analysis
## Excel VBA Module 2

### OverView of Stock_Analysis (VBA_Challenge) Project

	The stock analysis project analyzes an entire dataset of stock information (volume traded, starting prices and ending prices of a certain, sometimes selected, stock in a given year).
The purpose behind the project was by using different VBA formulas and functions, we could analyze several key stocks and their related information, without the need to go over them one by one, which is essentially time consuming.
At a click of a button, the project would analyze one to tens of different stocks, at any given year, analyzing key data such as the return of an example stock.

### Results
	Stock perfomance in 2018 was better than 2017
Nearly all (10 / 12) stocks out performed themselves in 2018 over 2017. Only tickers (RUN) and (TERP) had lesser returns in 2018 than in 2017. 

The same code was used to analyze both 2017 and 2018 years, in both the original and refactored scripts.

##### Original script vs refactored script
	Shorter run time, lesser code used and looks better.
The refactored script had a better execution time over the original script, as shown in these two images in 2017.
